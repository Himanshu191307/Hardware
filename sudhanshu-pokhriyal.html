                      <p>
			By emphasising the importance of the bathroom as a personal space, Sudhanshu Pokhriyal, CEO, Bathware Business, Hindware Limited recognises the potential for creating an environment that promotes relaxation, well-being, and self-expression “The bathroom is a space where a person has the opportunity to gather their thoughts in solace, given that it is a space where one is alone. You're thinking of the future. You're thinking of your anxieties, and you're thinking of making plans and you're prepping yourself up and whatnot,” says Sudhanshu. 
<br>The increasing demand for personalised experiences within bathroom spaces has paved the way for a revolution in the way bathrooms are designed and equipped, says Sudhanshu. The confluence of technology and functionality within bathroom spaces is an inevitable evolution. Technologies like showers that have integrated mood lighting, music settings, and automatic temperature control; vanity mirrors with LED integration, and water closets closely modelled on the famously high-tech Japanese ones have begun to gain a foothold in the Indian market. As technology continues to advance, these innovative bathroom fixtures and accessories are expected to become more prevalent in Indian homes.

</p><p>“Technology has now pervaded the bathroom space extensively and this integration of technology is going to increase as we go forward. says Sudhanshu. “With the expansion of features that come built into bathware products, more people are going to keep using such products. Hindware has products within this space that can be controlled through Bluetooth and with remote controls as well. These products of ours are selling extremely well in fact.” 
</p><p>The evolution of bathware products and the bathroom space goes beyond just technological advancements. It is crucial to consider sustainability as a significant dimension in this evolution. 
</p><p>“Indian customers have diverse needs and preferences. While the working class seeks technology-driven products at affordable prices and then there is a segment that is not really perturbed if a premium is charged for innovative products,” says Sudhanshu. “However, regardless of the price point, we must keep keeping sustainability in mind. It is the need of the hour and a prerogative of a lot of customers.” 
</p><p>Hindware continues to further redefine this space by taking firm steps to embed sustainability through innovation in bathroom products. 
</p><p>“We have collaborated up with a Swedish multinational who are leaders in innovation for water saving products for a nozzle which can be put on on a faucet used in a commercial space bathroom, for example, a hotel or a railway station, or the airport. This nozzle can save up to 98% water,” shares Sudhanshu. 
</p><p>We realise that innovation should not be limited to commercial spaces alone and Hindware has been actively working on introducing cost-effective innovative products across customer segments for decades now. With tankless, touch enabled products; and products that aim to conserve water significantly during flushing, Hindware is allowing everybody to contribute towards water conservation efforts. 
 </p><p>“A few years ago, all brands had products that used a minimum of 6 litres of water for each flush. Now that number has come down to 3 litres or even less than 3 litres,” said Sudhanshu. “There was no concept some time ago of anything like a half flush. A concept that Hindware pioneered is now widely adopted by other brands. This demonstrates our influence in driving industry-wide sustainability practices and is also a testament to our contribution to the industry in terms of sustainability.”
</p><p>The company’s commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in the entire process and value chain of the bathware business. From solar powered plants to product design and marketing, sustainability is the cornerstone of the company. 
</p><p>“The organisation’s outlook towards sustainability has strengthened further. Be it in manufacturing or product design or even the way the product is marketed. For example, if a product team is thinking about a product that delivers 98% water usage saving, it shows how the organisation is oriented right now.” 
</p><p>Product design is another area where sustainability takes center stage as it is a dominant factor in the buying decision of a customer.   
</p><p>“The bathroom has now become a space where design and aesthetics play a significant role. The bathware products, in my view, is a lifestyle product. Design is crucial in the success of a bathware products business,” says Sudhanshu. “Every brand in bath space has to work on the need to prioritise both design and product functionality to succeed.
</p><p>Hindware continues to create a large and diverse portfolio of products that cater to a large segment of consumer demands. Even with 2000 products, the portfolio and products keep evolving with the changing customer trends.  
</p><p>“To ensure the product offerings remain relevant and up-to-date, every year we phase out the bottom 20% of our products as this allows a lot of new products to get introduced into the mix.,” share Sudhanshu. “Some products have timeless appeal and remain in the product mix for an extended period, but it’s a standard KPI for our team to evaluate and validate the performance of products in the market.” 
</p><p>According to Sudhanshu growing a company doesn’t rely only on having a wide product range, it also stands heavily on creating value for everyone within the ecosystem which includes architects, interior decorators, employees, vendors, and other stakeholders.
</p><p>“Unless we generate value for each one of them, the organisation cannot really prosper,” says Sudhanshu. “For example, when we work with architects, give them a range of high-quality products that they can incorporate into their designs. By offering architects attractive options, we not only support their creative vision but also enhances their brand reputation.”
</p><p>Sudhanshu didn’t always think of joining the bathware space. But his career path and priorities led him toward this sector.
</p><p>When I interacted with the promoters before joining, I experienced a sense of revitalisation and saw the potential for adding value to the company.
</p><p>I personally feel that joining this organisation was a great decision for me,” “I personally feel that I am here for a very long inning, and I am sure that this journey will be extremely exciting., shares Sudhanshu.”
</p><p>Despite leading a demanding and structured life, I find relaxation and joy in spending time with his family.
</p><p>“I spend time with family before dinner. Conversation on the dinner table is usually catching up on what has been going on in everyone’s life and sharing what’s up in my life as well.” 
</p><p>Apart from spending time with the family, Sudhanshu ensures he stays fit by working out regularly as possible at the gym. An avid golfer, Sudhanshu tries to hit the course at least twice a week with his wife. He soon hopes to increase his handicap on the golf course from his current score, planning to conquer the fairways and greens the way Hindware has conquered the Indian market.

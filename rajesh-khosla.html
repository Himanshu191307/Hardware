                        Rajesh Khosla, CEO, AGI Greenpac<sub></sub></p>
                    <p>
                        Rajesh Khosla, Chief Executive Officer, AGI Greenpac is at the helm of a business that is
                        quietly beginning a journey of step-change innovation in the products it delivers. Various
                        factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing environmental consciousness, customer
                        demands, etc. are reshaping the packaging products industry. This creates an opportunity
                        for the introduction of newer technologies that add increased value to meet evolving
                        customer demands.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Rajesh, the Covid-19 pandemic was a catalyst for innovation within the
                        packaging products space. Surprisingly, the restrictions imposed by the pandemic have had
                        a positive impact on the design, manufacturing, and usage of packaging, rather than a
                        negative one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “During the pandemic, people started giving importance to the type of packaging due to
                        concerns about hygiene. Everyone wanted their products to be safe and virus free.
                        Additionally, packaging had to adapt to ensure products had a longer shelf life due to the
                        unpredictability of the situation. Packaging also had to account for products – such as food
                        items being shipped across large distances. For example, from Europe to India or vice
                        versa.” shares Rajesh.

                    <p>The packaging industry including AGI Greenpac has also been making significant strides
                        towards contributing to sustainability-oriented goals. While the timelines may vary across
                        industries and economies, the ultimate goal remains the same for most of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We are actively addressing sustainability concerns through a two-pronged approach.
                        Firstly, in the manufacturing process itself, we are committed to minimising the carbon
                        footprint. This is done through exploring the increased use of renewable energy,” says
                        Rajesh. “Secondly, we are focused on manufacturing products that can be recycled and
                        reused. We try to use materials that can be effectively recycled and are collaborating with
                        companies to eliminate secondary packaging from our products. For example, we are
                        exploring the use of reusable crates that can be used multiple times. With these innovations
                        and, coupled with a shift in perspectives, we are moving towards carbon neutrality.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In the packaging sector, AGI Greenpac continues to be at the forefront of industry
                        advancements. Significant investments have been made in processes and emerging
                        technologies to reduce material usage and increase the use of sustainable fuel sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We are aiming to reduce the weight of glass packaging products substantially while
                        ensuring integrity for usage and sustainability. AGI Greenpac has expanded its capabilities in
                        producing high-end products by installing a 154 tonne speciality glass manufacturing plant
                        which enables us to deliver premium offerings. We have also invested in the creation of a
                        decoration unit to create various shapes, designs, and decorations for our packaging
                        products, directly enhancing the customer experience. This is one part that directly impacts
                        the customer,” says Rajesh. “When it comes to manufacturing innovation, AGI Greenpac is
                        embracing new technologies. We are using multiple alternate power sources for
                        manufacturing such as solar energy and are currently conducting trials with hydrogen gas.
                    </p>
                    <p>Along with this, we are implementing various inspection and quality control technologies to
                        ensure the highest standards are maintained throughout the manufacturing process.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to sustainability efforts, Rajesh underscores the ongoing significance of
                        packaging design in influencing consumer purchasing decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Packaging of any product is the first line of contact with the consumer. It is obvious that the
                        more innovative the design, the more probability of people being attracted to it. This is the
                        reason even at AGI Greenpac we have a creative design team that continuously creates
                        new designs for various segments enabling us to provide enhanced value through
                        packaging,” shares Rajesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Packaging should create value for the consumer, along with fulfilling its intended purpose.
                        With the advent of newer technologies and digitisation, there will be increased opportunities
                        to provide consumers with more information about the product,” says Rajesh. “For example,
                        there is a bottle when manufactured is green, but once the product reaches its expiry date,
                        the colour of the bottle changes.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“In terms of product development, technology, and innovation; substantial work is underway,
                        and we see a transformative change on the horizon for the industry in the near future.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Rajesh sees a significant opportunity for the packaging products industry in India driven by
                        the economic growth of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>He says, “As the economy and GDP grow, people will not only consume more products, but
                        they will consume products with proper packaging. Furthermore, a number of industries are
                        opting for glass packaging for their products, presenting an enhanced opportunity for AGI
                        Greenpac.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Furthermore, people are moving towards premium packaging and in the future, the quality
                        of packaging will play a crucial role in determining the perceived value of a product,” he
                        adds.
                    </p>
                    <p>Streamlining AGI’s PET and Closures businesses is also on the board for Rajesh. He sees it
                        as an opportunity to create a one-stop-shop for clients&#39; packaging product needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The pet bottles &amp; products and security caps &amp; closures businesses complement our glass
                        packaging capabilities This allows us to provide clients with a comprehensive range of
                        packaging solutions all under one roof. By offering integrated packaging solutions, we
                        eliminate the need for customers to source products from multiple suppliers, streamlining
                        their operations. In case there is any issue or challenge, we resolve it efficiently through
                        internal coordination. The credibility and success of one business positively impact the other,
                        fostering a synergistic environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>He believes that culture is equally important in AGI’s success journey. He wants to shape
                        AGI Greenpac as a place that is vibrant and fun, where challenges are met with
                        enthusiasm.
                    </p>

                        experience a smooth journey. I don&#39;t want them to feel exhausted from hard work. Instead, I
                        want them to find joy and fulfilment at work. I want our company and importantly our people
                        to be the best in their respective fields.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Rajesh’s insights that are redefining packaging products come from working in a different
                        sector, that has surprising similarities. Prior to joining AGI Greenpac in 2018, he worked in
                        the steel industry. Interestingly, he found several similarities between these two sectors,
                        which facilitated a smooth transition for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Whatever I was doing in the steel sector, could easily have been replicated in the glass
                        sector. While the fundamental business principles remained unchanged, the operational
                        aspects were distinct. Working with glass, a truly captivating product, presented a refreshing
                        experience. The industry boasts great customers, expansive prospects, and a pressing need
                        for innovation. It offers a rich environment for individuals like me to explore new avenues and
                        bring ideas to life. It helped me realise my dream of working in a business where there is
                        both that embraces both tradition and innovation.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Managing such a diverse business can be tiring for anyone. However, Rajesh believes that
                        once you start loving your job, loving your product, and loving your business; the work itself
                        become a way to unwind. While he doesn’t feel any physical tiredness, his favourite way to
                        get rid of mental tiredness is to go for walks with his wife while having a chat about his and
                        her day or watch YouTube videos to keep himself updated on the latest trends in business
                        and current events.

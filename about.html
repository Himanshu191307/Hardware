                     <p>We, at Somany Impresa, believe excellence is more than just a pursuit for businesses, the economy and the society. It is a state of mind. Only when you believe in excellence, will your actions reflect this emotion. Excellence, however, cannot survive or thrive in a vacuum. It needs a favourable macro environment and consistent meticulous nurturing. The overarching reality in India holds significant promise and I feel it is only befitting to say a few words here in this context, before we focus on how Somany Impresa is capitalising on the big opportunities.</p>
